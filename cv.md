## About:
25 y.o.  
I am currently studying to become a front-end developer. My goal is to gain as much knowledge as I can and get a job.
## Skills:
* JS basics
* C/C++
* Git
## Code examples:
**JS: sorting a given string**
(**e.g. "is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est**)

        function order(words){
        return words.split(' ').sort(function(a,b)
        {
        return a.match(/\d/) - b.match(/\d/);
        }).join(' ');
        }
**C: checking if c is digit or not**

        int		ft_isdigit(int c)
    {
        if (c <= '9' && c >= '0')
            return (1);
        else
            return (0);
    }
